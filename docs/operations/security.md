# Security

Use this runbook before exposing Griglia and after changes to authentication, uploads, themes, agents or
infrastructure. Know the active mode and have access to the host authentication, HTTPS and storage settings.

The full model, the hardening checklist and how to report a vulnerability are in
[SECURITY.md](https://github.com/alle80/griglia/blob/master/SECURITY.md). The short version:

The latest source review and its prioritized findings are in the
[security assessment dated 2026-08-21](security-assessment-2026-08-21.md).


## What the package guarantees

- **Everything is scoped to its owner.** Lists, tasks, sub-tasks, questions and attachments are always read
  through the current user's scope: there is no route that returns someone else's board.
- **Administration is a separate gate.** Settings, the agent context and theme packs are admin-only —
  `canManageGriglia()`, a Gate ability or `GRIGLIA_ADMINS`; by default only the first registered user.
  See [Access & modes](../configuration/access.md).
- **Uploads are validated**: type and size checked, images re-encoded, stored on the private `local` disk by
  default, and served only through the owner-scoped controller. Keep `GRIGLIA_ATTACHMENTS_VIA_CONTROLLER=true`.
- **Theme packs are treated as code**: administrator-only install, SVG refused, CSS sanitised (no `@import`,
  no external urls), caps on file size, pack size and number of entries, assets served from a sandboxed route.
- **Expensive endpoints are rate-limited** (transcription, test notification, push subscription).
- **Secrets stay in `.env`** and in the host scripts: nothing that reaches the browser or a theme pack.

## What is up to you

- Keep the board behind your app's login (server mode). **Local mode has no authentication at all**: bind it
  to `127.0.0.1`, never expose it.
- Put the app behind HTTPS — Web Push and the microphone need a secure context anyway.
- Give the agent the credentials it needs and nothing more: it runs on your machine, with your shell.

## Reporting

Before release, verify that anonymous requests cannot open a server-mode board, ordinary users cannot reach
administration, attachments remain owner-scoped, local mode listens only on loopback, and `composer audit`
passes. The dated assessment above is historical evidence for its stated version, not a guarantee for later
deployments.

Please do not open a public issue for a vulnerability: the contact and the disclosure process are in
