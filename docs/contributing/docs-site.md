# Building this documentation site

The docs are plain Markdown in `docs/` with a `mkdocs.yml` (theme **Material for MkDocs**) at the package root.
The site is **bilingual**: English is the base language, Italian pages sit next to them as `page.it.md` —
see [Translations](translations.md).
The small version label below the footer is filled at build time by `docs_hooks.py`: it reads the first
released version in `CHANGELOG.md`, so the published site follows each release without a second version field
to update.

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install -r requirements-docs.txt   # Python 3.8+; mkdocs + Material + the static-i18n plugin
```
or, without Python, Docker: `griglia:docs-build --docker` builds the toolchain image from `docs.Dockerfile`
(the official `squidfunk/mkdocs-material` image alone is not enough — it does not ship the i18n plugin).

Half a toolchain — `mkdocs` and Material installed, `mkdocs-static-i18n` missing — is the common case: the
command stops on `The "i18n" plugin is not installed` and adds the line to fix it (install the plugins, or
build with `--docker`).

## Generated pages

Three pages of the Reference section are written by the package itself, in both languages:

```bash
php artisan griglia:docs-generate            # → docs/reference/{commands,config,settings}.md + .it.md
php artisan griglia:docs-generate --check    # fails when the committed pages are out of date (CI)
```

The Italian versions come from the same code: the settings from the `it` translations of the page, the
command and config descriptions from the catalogue in `resources/docs/reference.it.php`
(see [Translations](translations.md)).

`griglia:docs-build` runs it before every build (`--no-generate` to skip), so the site always matches the
code. Do not edit those three files by hand.

`--check` is meant for the package repository (and its CI): run inside a host app the settings page
legitimately differs, because it lists the AI providers installed there.

### One comment per config key

The «What it is» column of `reference/config.md` is the `//` comment written **right above** the key in
`config/griglia.php`, and that comment belongs to that key alone: it is not carried over to the keys that
follow it. So a group like `admin_gate` + `admins` needs one comment each — sharing a single block comment
used to give every key of the block the same description. A key left with no comment of its own gets an empty
cell and `griglia:docs-generate` warns about it (an error under `griglia:docs-build --strict`).

## Build

```bash
php artisan griglia:docs-build                    # → site/ (HTML)
php artisan griglia:docs-build --serve            # live preview on http://127.0.0.1:8000
php artisan griglia:docs-build --out=/var/www/docs
php artisan griglia:docs-build --docker           # builds and uses the docs.Dockerfile image
```

The command runs `mkdocs build` (or the Docker image) from the package directory, reports a clear error when
MkDocs is missing (with the install hint) or when the build fails (stderr), and prints where the HTML went.
Equivalent without artisan: `mkdocs build` in the package root.

## Diagrams

A diagram is a ```` ```mermaid ```` fence (see [architecture](../architecture.md)): Material renders it in the
browser, loading Mermaid from a CDN, and a reader without that CDN still sees the source of the diagram. Keep
the source readable for exactly that reason, and keep a diagram to what a table cannot say.

## The whole loop, for an agent

Working on the package, the documentation is part of the change — not an afterthought:

1. **Write** the page in `docs/` (never the generated ones: `reference/{commands,config,settings}.md` and
   their `.it.md`) — and its Italian counterpart, see [Translations](translations.md).
2. **Regenerate** what comes from the code, if you touched a command, a config key or a setting:
   `php artisan griglia:docs-generate` (from a host app) or `vendor/bin/testbench griglia:docs-generate`
   (inside the package repository).
3. **Validate**: `php artisan griglia:docs-build --strict` — warnings become errors, so a broken internal
   link or a page missing from the nav fails the build. `griglia:docs-generate --check` tells you whether
   the committed reference pages are stale; the CI runs it for you.
4. **Look at it**: `--serve` for a live preview, or build into a folder your web server already serves.
5. **Commit** `docs/`, `mkdocs.yml` and the regenerated pages together with the code change, and add the
   line to `CHANGELOG.md` — the changelog *is* a page of the site.

`griglia:docs-build --strict` builds **both languages**: a broken link in the Italian tree fails the build
exactly like one in the English tree.

The production build uses directory URLs (`features/`); the preview uses explicit HTML files
(`features/index.html`). Custom template links must support both forms and never append `/` to `index`.

## Publishing

`.github/workflows/docs.yml` builds the site (`mkdocs build --strict`) and deploys it to **GitHub Pages** at
every push to `master` that touches `docs/`, `overrides/`, `mkdocs.yml` or `CHANGELOG.md`; it can also be
run by hand (*Run workflow*). The site needs no PHP to build, because the generated pages are committed —
`tests.yml` is what fails when they are out of date.

The repository must have **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions** enabled once, and `site_url` in
`mkdocs.yml` must match the published address.
